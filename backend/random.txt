Introduction to MERN Stack : 

M MongoDB - document database - aligned with javascript 
E ExpressJS - Node.js web framework
R ReactJS - A client-side javascript framework
N NodeJs - The premier Javascript web server

-----------------
 Now we'll create our own api and configure it with our own database.

with the help of express.js (node js web framework) we will write our backend api 
 : npm install express --save

backend will be maintained separately
and the reactjs application will be handled separately -> the reactjs frontend will use the api backend to retreive data 

nodemodules will be separate for both 

--- 
Installations:
express.js -> npm install express --save
mongoDB -> installed in computer for development, and when the application will be live it will be installed in the server as well ideally

---
mongoDB is a document database
we can randomly throw javascript object in the mongoDB database
- collections concept 
- database concept
 ---------
 what is mongoose ?
 Mongoose is an abstraction layer on top of mongoDB which helps us connect to our nodejs application

 ---
 database -> contains collections -> contains documents


 ---
 we can directly make the database collections and documents, which will be very tedious
 so we have the mongoose models for creating the MongoDB database

---
we will make our own api and our own database and store the data in our database. and then start building our application.
----------------

- we will make our own api -> npx create-react-app inotebook -> notebook on the cloud -> login authentication 
- we need to create our own api using express server.
-> frontend portion and api portion will be seperately made. => react application + api (nodejs project)

-> because our api (backend) will be hit and requested to give responses more often than our frontend react application which is uploaded only once on the browser when accessed. => so we want our backend api to be on another separate server which is stronger(more bandwidth).

-> login and signup and how to deal the security.

-> we can create this as a social media application using websockets - because the concepts are same.

hello everyone
in this video we are going to look at the concept of searching in Data-structures and algorithms, primarily we will focus on binary search and some special cases and like floor and ceil values and we will solve some questions on Leetcode.
